//Node js-Node js is a runtime environment that lets run javascript on server side.build on chromes v8 javascript engine(run code outside the browser)
//used to create fast,scalable web application

//Express js-it is a minimal and flexible web framework for node js.
//It helps to handle routes,middlewares and http requests easily.
//makes backend development fast and simple.

//why we use express js
//simplifies server creation in node js.it offers powerfull features like routing,middleware,static file serving,error handling.

//NPM-Node Package Manager
//npm is a tool to install packages or libraries from the node js ecosystem.

//npm init-asking which package you want
//npm init -y-without asking any questions directly install the packages
//when install express creating node modules and package lock.json

//what is package.json,difference between package.json and package-lock.json
//package.json contains configuration-project name,version,description,main file name(exp05.js)
//package-lock.json-same as package.json but it gives detailed information,contains dev dependency,dependency
//dev dependency used for developers and dependency used for building purpose(see difference in detail)

//activity-see http methods real-time eg
/*methods => 1 get = for read data (display data)
             2 post = for write or create data
             3 put = for update data
             4 delete = for remove data

const app = express() //whatever things in express that are now in app
const port = 3000 //localhost 3000 when run on browser
